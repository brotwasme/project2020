prior efffect on modeling look at: 
			- speed (and efficency)
			- acuracy
	loop through model with diffrent prior ranges
-size of priour range 
-possibly also look at impossible priours (correct value not in range, by an amount) 
-difrent priour shape (gaussian, with mean at correct place or off by amount, 2 peaked gaussian [representing 2 possible favourable solutions])
-percentage based
