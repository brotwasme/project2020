prior efffect on modeling look at: 
			- speed (and efficency)
			- acuracy
	loop through model with diffrent prior ranges
-size of priour range 
-possibly also look at impossible priours (correct value not in range, by an amount) 
-difrent priour shape (gaussian, with mean at correct place or off by amount, 2 peaked gaussian [representing 2 possible favourable solutions])
-percentage based

list of priorities to try are:
1. idea about influence of different priors - this relates to the arguments considered around eq. (16) & (17) in the Bradley W. Treece paper [Optimization of reflectometry experiments]
2. Repeating (just using ultranest) for different Q_max: this should be really easy to implement as a loop - use my initial calculation of the model experimental data and then just chop the [Q,R(Q)] arrays at different points - this relates to Section 3.1.4 in that paper and Figure 6. 
3. The final thing might take a bit more setup on simons part to get the model system right - He would propose something similar to section 3.2 in that paper, but based on some of the experimental data that he have.
